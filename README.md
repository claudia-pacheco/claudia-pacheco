### Hi there! ðŸ‘¾

Welcome to my <i>(coding)</i> world! I'm a Software Dev with expertise in web development, especially in JavaScript and React, part of the MERN Stack crew. I've also worked with Python, Django, Node.js, Material UI, PostgreSQL, HTML, and CSS. After starting a Computer Science degree at the University of Hertfordshire for a year, I enrolled into a Software Engineering Immersive course at General Assembly to supercharge my coding game.

Currently, I am working as a Front End Developer within the Financial Services industry, continually growing in the dynamic world of software development.
