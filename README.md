### Hi there! ðŸ‘¾

As a Junior Software Engineer, I possess substantial expertise in web development, particularly with JavaScript and React, operating on MERN Stack. My proficiency also extends to other technologies such as Python, Django, NodeJs, Material UI, PostgreSQL, HTML, and CSS. After pursuing Computer Science at the University of Hertfordshire for a year, I pursued a Software Engineering Immersive course at General Assembly to broaden my knowledge base.

Currently, I am seeking a dynamic and collaborative work environment where I can apply my education and skillset, as well as learn and develop alongside like-minded individuals.

Technologies I have worked with:<br><br>
